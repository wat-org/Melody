DiskListEx_DEVICE_ALREADY_DEFINE=''{0}'': Not accepted. A Disk Device with the same Device Name has already been declared. It is not allowed to attach two (or more) Disk Device with the same Device Name to the to the same Instance. To solve this issue, change the Device Name of the Disk Device.
DiskListEx_MULTIPLE_ROOT_DEVICE_DEFINE=''{0}'': Not accepted. A Root Device has already been declared. It is not allowed to declare two (or more) Root Device. To solve this issue, remove the root-device attribute of the Disk Device.

DiskDevLoaderEx_MISSING_ATTR=Mandatory attribute ''{0}'' is missing.
DiskDevLoaderEx_GENERIC_ERROR=This Disk Device description is not valid. Read message bellow to get more details about this issue.
DiskDevLoaderEx_EMPTY_DISKDEV_LIST=No Disk Device Found! An Instance must contains at least one Disk Device. To solve this issue, you should either modify the ''{0}'' XML Attribute of the ''{1}'' XML Element of the related Instance, so that it matches existing Disk Device Nodes, or add new Disk Device Nodes.

DiskDefEx_EMPTY_DEVICE_LIST=No Disk Device. To solve this issue, add a Disk Device Node to this Instance Node, with a ''{0}'' XML attribute equals to ''{1}''.
DiskDefEx_UNDEF_ROOT_DEVICE=Root Device is not declared. To solve this issue, declare a ''{0}'' XML attribute to the Disk Device ''{1}'' and set it to ''true''.
DiskDefEx_INCORRECT_ROOT_DEVICE=Root Device declaration is not valid. To solve this issue, remove the ''{0}'' XML attribute of device ''{1}'', and declare a ''{0}'' XML attribute to device ''{2}'' and set it to ''true''.

DiskDeviceSizeEx_EMPTY_SIZE=''{0}'': Not accepted. Since this value is an empty String, such value is not a valid Disk Device Size.
DiskDeviceSizeEx_NEGATIVE_SIZE=''{0}'': Not accepted. Disk Device Size must be positive Integer.
DiskDeviceSizeEx_INVALID_SIZE=''{0}'': Not accepted. Since this value doesn''t respect the pattern ''{1}'', such value is not a valid Disk Device Size.

DiskDeviceNameEx_EMPTY=''{0}'': Not accepted. Since this value is an empty String, such value is not a valid Disk Device Name.
DiskDeviceNameEx_INVALID=''{0}'': Not accepted. Since this value doesn''t respect the pattern ''{1}'', such value is not a valid Disk Device Name.

DiskMgmtEx_SELECTOR_INVALID_XPATH=''{0}'': Not accepted. Since this value is not a valid XPath Expression, such value is not a valid Disk Devices Selector. Replace it with an XPath Expression, which match the Disk Device XML Element Nodes of the related Instance.
DiskMgmtEx_SELECTOR_NOT_MATCH_ELMT=''{0}'': Not accepted. Since this expression doesn''t target only XML Element Nodes, such value is not a valid Disk Devices Selector. Replace it with an XPath Expression, which match the Disk Device XML Element Nodes of the related Instance.
